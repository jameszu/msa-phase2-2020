# Voting Webapp frontend
[Here](https://a-vote.azurewebsites.net/) is the demo
The idea actually comes from the piazza polling. And more to add after finish. <br>
Ok so bascially 5 pages. <br>
When the useru first acess to the website, it need to enter the name. <br>
After submitted the name, it redirected to the homepage for create/look at the polls. <br>
Then the user can create polls at the same page. <br>
After the poll is created, the user can see the created poll at the homepage and can click into that.<br>
There will be more editing and results once click into that. 
### For frontend

Using the material-ui for styling. <br>
Created a simple logo for the website.
